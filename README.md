# 01-Guessing
This is my first project for C220, a guessing game written in Python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.

The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player then has as many oppurtunities as necessary to refine the guess. The game reports the total number of tries taken.
